      <p>In 2017, New Orleans, LA was ranked the fourth deadliest city in the United States. Children that grow up in poverty are more likely to face health problems, a higher risk of teen pregnancy, poorer access to a good education, more family life disruptions and a greater propensity to crime according to US Surgeon Generalâ€™s Study on Youth Violence. I decided to take a look at whether the education and poverty levels of children in New Orleans from 2012-2016 affected local crimes such as homicide, rape, burglary, battery and theft.<p>

      <p>Outside of the French Quarter and Downtown, a majority of the crimes in New Orleans I looked at took place in New Orleans East, Uptown, Mid-City and the West Bank area. <p>

      <p>According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are the highest levels of 18-24 year olds without highschool dipolmas in the West Bank, New Orleans East and Mid City areas.<p>

      <p>Louisiana tied with Ohio as the second worst state for black youth educational attainment, according to a report from the Annie E. Casey Foundation.<p>

      <p>The problem of child poverty is especially severe in New Orleans, where 39 percent of children below the age of 18 lived in poverty from 2012-2016. That was nearly 10 points higher than the rest of Louisiana. The child-poverty rate is even worse compared to the national leve. The national child-poverty rate was at a post-recession high of 18.1 in 2012 and declined to 15.6 percent in 2016.  <p>
